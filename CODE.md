C.O.D.E. Framework: Your Problem-Solving System

A personalized method for tackling programming problems like a pro. This lives in your repo as a reminder and guide â€” and it's ready to print or share.

ðŸ§© Overview

C.O.D.E. stands for:

Clarify the problem

Organize test cases

Design the algorithm

Execute & evaluate

It helps break down complex challenges into bite-sized, repeatable steps. A great companion for daily coding, debugging, or job interviews.

ðŸ”¹ C â€“ Clarify the Problem

What am I solving? What are the rules?

Restate the problem in plain English.

Identify explicit constraints and implicit assumptions.

Define what success looks like (e.g., return type, range, shape).

Use 1â€“2 lines to summarize the problem scenario.

ðŸ§  Example: "I'm building a pyramid using cube layers. Each upper block requires 4 lower supports."

ðŸ”¹ O â€“ Organize the Test Cases

What inputs and outputs confirm this works?

Start with concrete examples (small numbers, 0, 1).

Add edge cases, large inputs, and weird cases.

Use assert or structured test functions for clarity.

ðŸ§  Write it like this:

assert func(0) == 0
assert func(5) == 0
assert func(13) == 8

ðŸ”¹ D â€“ Design the Algorithm

What are the steps from input to output?

Write logic as a numbered list or pseudocode.

Work through 1â€“2 examples by hand.

Choose your control structures (loop? recursion? stack?).

ðŸ§  Example: "Use layer^2 blocks each time. Subtract from total. Stop when not enough blocks for next layer."

ðŸ”¹ E â€“ Execute & Evaluate

Write the code. Then break it.

Implement the function using your design.

Run all test cases immediately.

Refactor for clarity or performance.

Add comments only if they clarify why, not what.

ðŸ§  Once it works, try rewriting in one fewer line for fun.

ðŸ›  Optional Add-Ons for Interviews (C.O.D.E.R.S.)

R â€“ Refactor: Improve variable names, simplify logic.

S â€“ Scalability: Consider Big O, memory usage, and weird input.

ðŸ“Œ Recommended Use

Include this in every problem directory as a README.md template.

Tape a printout near your desk for real-life sessions or whiteboarding.

Convert this to Notion, Obsidian, or VS Code snippet for fast access.

Happy debugging! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
