# 🧠 PY110: Advanced Python Concepts

Welcome to **PY110 – Advanced Python**, the next step in my journey from diesel to debugging. This repo contains all my notes, exercises, and practice problems as I dive deeper into Python's advanced features and best practices.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

This phase focuses on leveling up beyond the basics, including:

- **Function Internals**  
  - `*args`, `**kwargs`, unpacking patterns  
  - Default arguments and their traps  
- **First-Class Functions & Functional Programming**  
  - Higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `lambda`)  
  - Closures, scopes, and the LEGB rule  
- **Decorators & Generator Functions**  
  - Creating and applying decorators  
  - Lazy evaluation, yield, and generator pipelines  
- **Object-Oriented Deep Dive**  
  - Dunder methods, custom classes  
  - Inheritance, mixins, and method resolution order (MRO)  
- **Namespaces & Variable Scope**  
  - Globals, locals, shadowing, and scope resolution  
- **Comprehensions & Advanced Iteration**  
  - Nested comprehensions, dictionary/set/list builds  
- **Error Handling Mastery**  
  - Custom exceptions, try/except/finally patterns  
- **Module Design & Import Mechanics**  
  - `__name__ == "__main__"`, relative vs absolute imports  
- **Intro to Testing**  
  - `unittest`, `doctest`, test-driven mini-examples

## 🧰 How I’m Using This Repo

- **Study & Review:** Every topic is reinforced with notes and breakdowns in `notes/`
- **Hands-on Coding:** I’m solving exercises progressively from easy to hard
- **Reflection & Growth:** Comments inside code files will show not just *what* the solution is, but *why* I chose it
